JPA Java Persistent API

ORM (Object Relational Mapping) - map java class to table of database
Fields gets mapped to column in table

Hibernate is one of the implementation of JPA 
- to create our own implementation 
- JPA is interface and hibernate is an implementation
JPA provides some core methods using which you can query your dbms, 
and if that is not sufficient then go for hibernate or go for your own implementation

JPQL - Java Persistence Query Language
Similar to SQL
SQL refers to table and column
JPQL refers to class and variables

Advantages to ORM or JPA 
- we are not writing native SQL query, it is based on class and variable. 
So it is not coupled with db. Have choice to change database in future

each repository is interface not class
